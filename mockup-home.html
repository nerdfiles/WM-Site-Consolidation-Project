                        <p>American Landfill utilizes highly trained and skilled professionals to perform the required environmental monitoring at the site.</p>
                        <h3>Surface Water Monitoring</h3>
                        <p>Six sedimentation ponds are sampled and tested weekly, monthly, semi-annually, and annually for different parameters in accordance with American Landfill's surface water permits. <a href="#" title="Monthly reports">Monthly reports</a> are submitted to the Ohio EPA, and records are maintained at the facility. In addition to surface water testing, inspections are performed on a monthly and quarterly basis in accordance with the facility's storm water pollution prevention plan.</p>
                        <h3>Groundwater Monitoring</h3>
                        <p>Another key component of American Landfill's environmental program is groundwater protection. It is included in all aspects of development from the initial planning, through the permitting process, during operations, and post-closure.</p>
                        <img src="http://dummyimage.com/200x150/000/fff" height="150" width="200" class="align-right" />
                        <p>The groundwater monitoring system at American Landfill consists of a total of 38 monitoring wells that monitor three separate zones. These wells are sampled semi-annually for approximately 79 parameters and reports are submitted to the Ohio EPA and Stark County Health Department in accordance with the Ohio EPA rules. The groundwater monitoring team also performs the well inspection survey as part of the groundwater sampling. All corrective actions are immediately implemented if any deficiencies are noted.</p>
                        <h3>Gas Monitoring</h3>
                        <p>Gas monitoring is conducted on a monthly basis. Three permanent probes and several temporary monitors are located on site to monitor gas. Over 100 wells collect methane gas generated by the natural decomposition of waste. The collected gas is safely burned through a flare system or utilized at the gas plant for treatment and distribution. The gas system is monitored on a bi-weekly basis with the report submitted to the Canton City Health Department - Division of Air Pollution Control. The facility also conducts quarterly surface scans of the filled areas. The final surface of filled areas is scanned continuously with a gas monitor every 50 feet to monitor surface gas from the landfill cover on a quarterly basis. The report is submitted to the Canton City Health Department.</p>

                <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
                <div class="modal-window-container-inner">
                    <p>Waste Management ("Waste Management", "we", "us" or "our") respects the preferences of our customers and other users that access this Internet site to learn about or interact with us concerning the collection, storage, access and use of their personal and business information. Waste Management is continually developing mechanisms to enhance the user experience on this web site and to provide our users with greater choice related to information use and disclosure. By accessing the Waste Management web site (the "Site"), you agree to the Waste Management Privacy Policy. It is important that you review this Privacy Policy prior to registering on or using the Site.</p>
                    <p>Waste Management reserves the right to add to, update or otherwise modify this Privacy Policy at any time and we will post the revision date on this Privacy Policy page. If we make material changes to this policy, we will post notice of the change on our Home Page. The most current Privacy Policy will apply to all data and other information collected on the Site, no matter what version of the Privacy Policy was in effect when the information was collected.</p>
                    <p>In general, you can visit the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Our Web servers may collect the domain names, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors. This information is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the Site, pages viewed, and similar data. Waste Management uses this information to measure the use of our Site and to improve the content of our Site. There are times, however, when we may need personal information from you, for instance: to process an order, to correspond with you, to provide a service, or in connection with a job application. However, we will only collect this information when it is voluntarily submitted to us. When any personal information is collected, we will let you know, at the time of collection, how we will use the information you give to us by reference to this Privacy Policy.</p>
                    <h3>Your Personal Information</h3>
                    <p>Waste Management will use personally identifiable information voluntarily submitted to us to respond to requests you make of us or to contact you in connection with your requests. Additionally, Waste Management may use that information to determine how we can improve our Site, business and services. Any and all uses will comply with applicable law.</p>
                    <p>In addition, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a tiny element of data that a Web site (including our Site) can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so we can recognize you when you return. You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie.</p>
                    <p>As a general rule, we do not sell or rent your personal or business information to any third party, except as described below or in connection with effectively maintaining and operating the Site. However, Waste Management cooperates with law enforcement and judicial inquires and other third parties to enforce laws, intellectual property and other rights. It may be necessary to furnish your information to third parties in connection with these objectives.</p>
                    <p>If you are using features of the Site available exclusively for Waste Management shareholders, we may request your social security number or tax id to verify your identity and share ownership.</p>
                    <p>If you are using the Site to access our electronic payment system, we may request certain financial information so that we may effect the payment transaction. Our payment system may collect, store and use non-public personally identifiable information such as your name, address, credit card number, bank routing and account number, Waste Management account number and e-mail address to process your payments. In addition, the payment system will also collect information regarding the actual bill payment transactions, including the dates and amounts paid. Waste Management will store and protect this information in the same manner we store and protect other personal customer information, and this is true both for our current customers as well as our former customers. We will only disclose information to third parties about your account or the transfers you make:</p>
                    <p>Where it is necessary for completing transactions you authorize (for example, to an outside service provider that operates the electronic payment system for us),<br>OR<br>In order to verify the existence and condition of your account for a third party, such as a credit bureau,<br>OR<br>In order to comply with government agency or court orders,<br>OR<br>If you give us your written permission.</p>
                    <p>We may disclose the information we collect about you to our affiliates who offer you waste management and disposal services, and to nonaffiliated third parties that perform services on our behalf, including marketing services, or parties with whom we have joint services and/or joint marketing agreements. We reserve the right to provide non-personal identifying information, such as aggregate data, to third parties.</p>
                    <p>Waste Management is concerned with the security of the data and information we collect and we use commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to help ensure the security, integrity and privacy of all personal information. However, due to the inherent insecurity of the Internet, no security measures should be viewed as one hundred percent effective in all circumstances. Waste Management cannot absolutely guarantee against a breach of its security or the actions of third parties that may seek to obtain unauthorized access to personal information.</p>
                    <p>In the event of a security breach in which personal information has been acquired, or is reasonably believed to have been acquired, by an unauthorized person, and where applicable law requires notification, Waste Management will notify the affected individual of the breach electronically, by email or fax, or if unable to contact the individual electronically, then by US Mail. This notice will be given in a timely manner, consistent with legitimate needs of law enforcement and any measures necessary for Waste Management or law enforcement to determine the scope of the breach and to restore and assure the integrity of the data system.</p>
                    <p>In the case where law enforcement determines that notification will impede a criminal investigation, Waste Management may delay notification until law enforcement or we determine that notification will not compromise the investigation.</p>
                    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy you may contact:</p>
